# Secure Development : Bank Mobile Applications



## Restricted access to the app

In order to check if user is the right one when starting the app, I opted for a biometric authentification.

When the user open the app for the first time, he has to authenticate with biometric, then he has to enter its bank account ID.
When he opens the app later he just needs to authenticate with biometric.

## user's data securely saved on the phone


By following recommandations on this link : https://developer.android.com/topic/security/data#kotlin ,  I save data thanks to EncryptedSharedPreferences.

So, we can find files on the phone but datas are unreadable. See below :
