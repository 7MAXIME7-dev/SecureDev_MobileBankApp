# Secure Development : Bank Mobile Applications



## Restricted access to the app

In order to check if user is the right one when starting the app, I opted for a biometric authentification.
When the user open the app for the first time, he first has to authenticate with biometric, then he has to enter its bank account ID.
When he open the app later he just need to authenticate with biometric.
